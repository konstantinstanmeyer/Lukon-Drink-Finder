Pitch: When entering our website users will be presented with a dropdown menu of different liquors that they can select from and be presented with different cocktails that they can make with said liquor, along with the ingredients to make the beverage and an expandable list of the recipe to make it. There will also be a “favorite” option that lets users add the specific cocktail to their favorites list. Finally there will be a list of “recommended drinks” that randomly populates everytime someone loads the page.

UserStory: As a user I can select a liquor from a dropdown menu and a random cocktail that can be made from said liquor. Then, the user can select the recipe button under the given drink and the recipe will be displayed.
