Pitch: When entering our website users will be presented with a dropdown menu of different liquors that they can select from and be presented with different cocktails that they can make with said liquor, along with the ingredients to make the beverage and an expandable list of the recipe to make it. There will also be a “favorite” option that lets users add the specific cocktail to their favorites list. Finally there will be a list of “recommended drinks” that randomly populates everytime someone loads the page.

UserStory: As a user I can select a liquor from a dropdown menu and return a list of different cocktails that can be made from said liquor. As a user I can favorite individual drinks and add them to a “my favorite drinks” list. As a user I can click on the recipe for each individual cocktail and expand all the steps in the recipe.
